# 🩺 Disease Prediction Toolkit: Building and Evaluating ML Models

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Machine Learning in healthcare** by building predictive models for diseases using datasets such as **Heart Disease UCI** and **Diabetes**.  
It showcases **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization**, making it an excellent portfolio project for healthcare AI/ML roles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn ML fundamentals with healthcare datasets
- Preprocess real-world data (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Train models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Evaluate using metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Create professional documentation & visualizations

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (Google Colab)
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** → handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale data  
2. **Model Training** → Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
3. **Evaluation** → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix  
4. **Visualization** → ROC curve, Confusion matrix  

---

## 📈 Results (Heart Disease Example)
- Logistic Regression: **Accuracy = 85%**
- Decision Tree: **Accuracy = 80%**
- Random Forest: **Accuracy = 89%**
